# unit-4-game
Crystal Collector

A small game that uses random number generators and click events.

Challenges: 
Besides getting the numbers specifc and different,
the reset function had a bug and was difficult to fix.
Again, it was a small mistake of reassigning a variable inside the function, rather than just
changing it.
